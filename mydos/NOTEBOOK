EVALUATION
==========

Way to go!!! Nailed it.

Well, the idea was that if the user simply enter 'hello.bin' at the shell prompt, the shell
would understand that it should load and execute 'hello.bin'. Rather, your implementation
requires that the user enter the build command 'exec'. Not exactly what was specified but
that's ok. What really matters is that the implementation is very good.
